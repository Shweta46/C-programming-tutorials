/*
The calculations required in the recursive approach is more as compared to iterative approach.
Calculations:
fib(4) --> fib(3)        +           fib(2)
            |                         |
      fib(1) + fib(2)             fib(0) + fib(1)

And, so on.
The number of calls grows exponentially and increased the time complexity.
