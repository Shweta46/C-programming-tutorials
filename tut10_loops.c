/*
Why do you program? Because you want the machine to do something that you are not willing to do.
Loops are used when we want something to repeat itself until some conditions are met.

Advantages of loops:
1. Code reusability
2. Saves time
3. Traversing - HOLD

BASIC SYNTAX:
Loop starts -->1. Check the condition --> False --> exit the loop
2. Check the condition --> True --> execute the loop i = i+1;

Types of loops:
1. do while
2. while
3. for
